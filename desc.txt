Notes:

Object oriented folder, please write code that uses the interfaces in the common folder. 
The interfaces must take into account both the functional and object oriented approach.
That is, there must not be a difference between a molecular graph built by the 
functional approach and the object oriented approach. Note that interfaces are contained in 
the Infrastructure project. Use the following scheme when building software:

Implementation -----> Infrastructure-Interface <----- Usage


That is, the usage and the implementation must be separated and the usage must be using only the interface and never 
the actual implementation.
